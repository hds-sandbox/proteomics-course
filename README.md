# The Clinical Proteomics Sandbox

This repository is used to collect the material related to teaching clinical proteomics. The material is divided into a number of modulse:

1. Identification
1. Quality Control
1. Bioinformatics
1. PhosphoProteomics

The corresponding subfolders contain the instructions, notebooks and other materials needed to complete the "course". Software and clinical datasets are available on [UCloud](cloud.sdu.dk) in the project "Proteomics Sandbox".
